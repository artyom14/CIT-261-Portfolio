Week 02 Journal
This week, I spent over 12-hours trying to complete the first 3 learning topics. My motivating drivers were: (1) get ahead of the topics lesson so that I don't fall behind and have time to ask questions and (2) meet my team's expectation of my giving the first lesson. The first topics served as a great re-introduction to HTML and Javascript. I viewed at least 400+ minutes of HTML and Javascript combined while I researched each topic. After completing the first set of topics, I feel more confident in this class.
